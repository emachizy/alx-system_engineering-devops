Issues and Analysis: Issue 1: Incorrect Location Data Users reported that the app was showing incorrect location data, leading to incorrect gym listings. The development team identified a bug in the app's location-based search functionality that caused the app to use inaccurate location data, leading to the display of incorrect gym listings.

Analysis: The issue was caused by the app's inability to fetch accurate location data from the user's device. This was due to a bug in the app's location-based search functionality that prevented the app from accurately retrieving location data. The development team fixed the bug by releasing a patch that addressed the issue.

Preventive Measures: To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the development team can implement automated testing procedures that test the app's location-based search functionality. They can also improve the app's location-based search functionality by using better location detection algorithms that can accurately fetch the user's location data.

Issue 2: App Crashes While Searching for Nearby Gyms Users reported that the app was crashing frequently while searching for nearby gyms. The app would become unresponsive and eventually crash, leading to a poor user experience.

Analysis: The issue was caused by the app's inability to handle large amounts of data when searching for nearby gyms. The app would become unresponsive and eventually crash when it encountered large amounts of data. The development team fixed the issue by optimizing the app's search algorithm, which reduced the amount of data the app had to handle when searching for nearby gyms.

Preventive Measures: To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the development team can implement automated testing procedures that test the app's search functionality. They can also improve the app's search algorithm by using more efficient data handling techniques that can handle large amounts of data without crashing.
Issue 3: Rating System Not Working Correctly Users reported that the app's rating system was not working correctly. The app would display incorrect ratings for gyms, leading to confusion and mistrust among users.

Analysis: The issue was caused by a bug in the app's rating system, which prevented it from accurately calculating gym ratings. The development team fixed the issue by
updating the app's rating system, which now accurately calculates and displays gym ratings.
Preventive Measures: To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the development team can implement automated testing procedures that test the app's rating system. They can also improve the app's rating system by using more accurate algorithms that can better calculate gym ratings.

Conclusion: The Gym Finder App faced several critical issues that led to its failure. The development team identified and addressed the issues promptly, but the negative impact on the app's ratings and downloads had already been done. To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the development team can implement preventive measures such as automated testing procedures, improved algorithms, and more efficient data handling techniques. By implementing these measures, the development team can ensure that the app's functionality remains intact and that users have a positive experience while using the app.
